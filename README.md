Dodge the Creeps

This is my recreation of the official Godot Engine tutorial game, "Dodge the Creeps," with some personal modifications. This repository contains all the source code and project files.

About This Project
This project was created as a learning exercise based on the "Your First 2D Game" tutorial in the official Godot documentation. I have implemented the core gameplay and added my own tweaks.
